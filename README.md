# The-Gaming-Room

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room (TGR) is looking to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
In terms of the actual documentation there were several areas such as researching the different services available for each aspect of the development process. The complex security systems available within an operating system was also properly noted. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Using it as a foundation for code development makes it easier and to meet the given costs. It also helps to make sure that all aspects of the client's fuctional software needs. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
There were several areas which could have been modified to show more technical answers and responses.  Other areas could have been more direct in their articulation and had specific examples in them to get the point across. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
Given our client's main goal is to attract more users, initially by expanding the software, it is very important to keep the end-user happy when engaging with the software. There were several cases which were addressed such as playability, the game integrity, and overall security of personal data. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
Keeping a similar structure would help in designing similar software. Having that initial outline and working with the client to make sure the foundations are secure and adequate, and then moving on to the other branches seems to be an ideal strategy.  Consistently checking on and updating the blueprint for the process is also a good way to engage with any roadbumps that come up along the way.
